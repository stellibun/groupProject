# About
This was for a group project, it's not very organized and could easily be much better.<br>
This is actually about a month or so old by the time I write this, I just forgot to upload it to Github.<br>
My group members, who I won't list by name to keep my own and their privacy, worked on a bit of this too.<br>
<small>(group projects are hard)</small>
