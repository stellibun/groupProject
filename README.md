# About
This was for a group project, it's not very organized and could easily be much better.<br>
This is actually about a month or so old by the time I write this, I just forgot to upload it to Github.<br>
My group members, who I won't list by name to keep my own and their privacy, worked on a bit of this too.

## Me
- Programming, all libraries, modules, etc.
## Group Member 1
- Lists of default people.
- A few calculations regarding the taxes. (Total outcome.)
## Group Member 2
- A few calculations regarding the taxes. (Dependents.)
